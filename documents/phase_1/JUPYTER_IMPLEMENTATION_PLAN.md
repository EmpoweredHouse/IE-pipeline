# Jupyter Notebook Implementation Plan: MRDA Dialogue Act Classification

## Model Repository Name
**HuggingFace Model Repo:** `your-username/distilbert-mrda-dialogue-acts`

## Training Strategy: Multi-Stage Approach
1. **Stage 1:** Train 12-class General DA classifier
2. **Stage 2:** Map to binary content/non-content classification
3. **Validation:** Test both stages incrementally

## Device Compatibility Strategy
- **Primary:** M1 Mac (MPS backend)
- **Fallback 1:** External GPU (CUDA)
- **Fallback 2:** CPU (slowest but functional)
